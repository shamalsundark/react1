            A substantial portion of Kerala including the western coastal
            lowlands and the plains of the midland may have been under the sea
            in ancient times. Marine fossils have been found in an area near
            Changanassery, thus supporting the hypothesis.[77] Pre-historical
            archaeological findings include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the
            Marayur area of the Idukki district, which lie on the eastern
            highland made by Western Ghats. They are locally known as
            "muniyara", derived from muni (hermit or sage) and ara (dolmen).[78]
            Rock engravings in the Edakkal Caves, in Wayanad date back to the
            Neolithic era around 6000 BCE.[79][80] Archaeological studies have
            identified Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic sites in Kerala.[81]
            The studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and
            its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age, through the
            Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic Ages.[82] Foreign cultural
            contacts have assisted this cultural formation;[83] historians
            suggest a possible relationship with Indus Valley civilization
            during the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age.[84]The Eastern world,
            also known as the East or historically the Orient, is an umbrella
            term for various cultures or social structures, nations and
            philosophical systems, which vary depending on the context. It most
            often includes at least part of Asia or, geographically, the
            countries and cultures east of Europe, the Mediterranean region and
            the Arab world, specifically in historical (pre-modern) contexts,
            and in modern times in the context of Orientalism.[1] It is often
            seen as a counterpart to the Western world, and correlates strongly
            to the southern half of the North–South divide.The Eastern world,
